"""
Sorting algorithms library.

Implements classic sorting algorithms for practice.
Each algorithm:
- Operates in place unless otherwise noted.
- Is annotated with stability characteristics.
- Will be evaluated for time and space complexity.

NOTE:
These implementations are obviously for learning purposes only.
I would of course use Python's built-in `sorted()` or database `ORDER BY` in
any real-world scenario.
