  - `add_product.html` (form to add product) ← UNFINISHED
- Quick side quest:
  - Need to merge into one unified DB under `core/database.py`

  - Windows can't run scanner listener as daemon; will use `evdev` on Linux to read input from barcode scanner specifically
**Next Up:**
- Write function to add product from barcode
**Stretch Goal:**
- Make Vesper detect repeat scans and increment quantity instead of duplicating


## [Mon 24.03.25]

**Goal:**
- Add product to grocery DB from barcode  
- (Stretch) Detect repeat scans & increase quantity
**Log:**
- Switched to ORM style for DB + queries
- Created `Product` model using ORM `Base` class (will expand later)
- Stretch goal not reached (big sad)
**Next time:**
1. Tweak `add_product` to detect repeats and increment quantity  
2. Fix `grocery.html` to generate table headers dynamically


## [Tue 25.03.25]

**Goals:**
1. Tweak `add_product` logic to detect repeat scans and increase quantity
2. Make `grocery.html` table headers generate dynamically
**Log:**

## [Wed 26.03.25]
**Log:**
- Installed Remote Development extension in VSCode
- Successfully connected to Raspberry Pi via SSH
**Next Time:**
1. Implement `add_product` route: accept scanned barcode, enter rest of product info, add to DB, show in UI  
2. Set up Flask-Migrate: init, create/apply schema version, test with `Product` model


## [Fri 28.03.25]
**Log:**
- Finalized `Product` model as permanent barcode-to-product record
- Introduced `Transaction` model for individual scans
- Fixed barcode being incorrectly used as primary key
**Next Time:**
1. On barcode scan:
   - If **not** in `Product`, prompt for name/price → add to `Product` and create `Transaction`
   - If **exists**, just create new `Transaction`
   - Need to finalize `add_product` and `add_transaction` functions


## [Sat 29.03.25]
**Goal:**
- Sort out logic for `add_product` and `add_transaction`
**Log:**
- Updated logic for both functions (still messy, need tests)
- Installed `pytest` and `pytest-mock`
**Tests to add:**
- Validation for DB entries (e.g., price formatting)
- Make `add_product` and `add_transaction` form fields mandatory


## [Sun 30.03.25]

**Goal:**
- Begin implementing tests using `pytest` / `pytest-mock`
**Log:**
- Cleaned up DB functions in `models.py` for better modularity
- Renamed `handle_barcode` → `process_scanned_barcode`
  - Retooled to auto-add transaction upon scan
  - Still need logic to trigger `add_product` UI if product not found
- Started unit tests:
  - `conftest.py`: In-memory DB fixture
  - `test_models.py`: Initial test for `add_product`
**Next Time:**
- Add WebSocket support to redirect to `/add_product` in real-time when scanned barcode doesn't exist


## [Tue 01.04.25]

**Goal(s):**
- Add "daily tether(s)" UI element to dashboard page  
  - Use Flexbox

- Began styling the card layout


## [Wed 02.04.25]
**Goal(s):**
- Finish JS logic for `tether-card` input  
  - Centered card, hover effects, editable state  
  - Clean styling, padding, spacing
**Log:**
- Block 1: Added JS to handle `tether-card` input
- Block 2: Added JS to hide button/input field once tether text is submitted
- Got sidetracked writing a couple unit tests—will revisit after completing styling
**Next Steps:**
- Finish JS styling
- Add unit tests for all functions in `groceries/repository.py`
- Add DB model for storing `tether-card` info (optional)
- Add WebSocket support to redirect to `/add_product` when scanned barcode is not found


## [Fri 04.04.25]

**Goal(s):**
- Expand unit testing coverage, starting with DB logic in `groceries/repository.py`
**Log:**
- Added input validation to `add_product`
- Added test cases for `add_product`:
  - Happy path  
  - Missing data  
  - Invalid price range
- Added 'no entries' & 'with entries' test cases for `get_all_products`
- Added test cases for `get_all_transactions`:  
  - No entries  
  - With entry  
  - Confirmed `joinedload` still works after session close
**Next Time:**
1. Expand test coverage:
   - `add_product`, `add_transaction`
   - `process_scanned_barcode`, `ensure_product_exists`


## [Wed 09.04.25]
**Goals:**
- Add `tasks` module and corresponding template
**Log:**
- Migrated to Blueprint architecture for routes:
  - `main`, `grocery`, and `tasks` (auth pending)
- Restructured `app/` directory
- Added pytest config


## [Thu 10.04.25]

**Goals:**
- Flesh out `tasks.html` and implement 3 recurring habits  
- *(Stretch)* Add habit streak UI
**Log:**
- Added `add_task` template
- Created `modules/tasks/repository.py` for DB logic
- Used GET/POST in `tasks_routes.py` to process form data and render `tasks.html` with task table

**Log:**
- Rendered “Today’s Habits” list on dashboard  
  - Filtered `Tasks` by habit type and `is_anchor` flag
- Added checkbox to mark task complete:
  - Used `fetch()` to POST to DB when clicked (via `onclick`)
  - Current state:
    - ❌ Feature not yet functional
    - `complete_task()` in `tasks_routes.py` needs to:
      - Identify task
      - Extract data from request
      - Set `is_done = True` and `completed_at = today`
    - JS only handles marking complete (unchecking doesn't undo)
    - Need to sanitize `completed_at` as date object
**Next Up:**
- Mark habit complete → update timestamp  
- Auto-reset daily via cronjob or first-run check


## [Fri 11.04.25]

**Log:**
- `complete_task()`:
  - Locates task
  - Sets `is_done = True`
  - Adds `completed_at = today`
  - Returns `jsonify(success=True)` to JS
- Updated `create_app()` to accept environment config params (`testing`, `dev`, etc)
  - Added `config.py` with `BaseConfig`, `DevConfig`, and `TestConfig`
- Installed Docker for PostgreSQL to replace SQLite
- Created `vesper` and `vesper_test` DBs in Docker container

- Installed `psycopg2-binary` in venv + added to `requirements.txt`
- All tests now run against PostgreSQL test DB  
  - Accurate `datetime` behavior and schema validation

## [Sat 12.04.25]

**Log:**
- Switched fully to PostgreSQL
- Installed `pytest-postgresql` for testing (added to `requirements.txt`)
- Uninstalled `psycopg2-binary`, installed `psycopg[binary]` instead (backend performance?)
- Installed local PostgreSQL for `pytest-postgresql` usage  
  - Local → for tests  
  - Docker container → for dev
- Ditched `pytest-postgresql` (broken / unmaintained)
  - Will connect tests directly to container DB
- Blocker: `pytest` can’t authenticate to DB
  - Password auth keeps failing despite being correct
  - Tried editing `pg_hba.conf` to allow local password auth (`md5`), no success


## [Sun 13.04.25]

**Log:**
- Set up PostgreSQL in Docker using `docker-compose.yml` and `init.sql`
- Integrated DB with Flask app and verified via:
  - Connection test
  - Table creation
  - Rollbacks
  - Constraint enforcement
- Structured test suite:
  - `unit/` and `integration/` folders
  - Configured `pytest.ini`
- Wrote first integration test: full task creation + completion flow
- Merged GET/POST logic into unified `/add_transaction` route
- Refactored DB session handling:
  - Switched to `scoped_session` with automatic teardown
  - No more manual `.close()`
  - Monkeypatched `get_db_session()` in tests to unify test + app session → avoids `DetachedInstanceError`
- Replaced unnecessary `.commit()`s in tests with `.flush()` for isolation

- Achieved near/full 100% test coverage
- Used test failures to detect & fix real bugs
- Cleaned up:
  - Removed dead comments
  - Renamed helpers
  - Standardized naming across modules
**TODOs:**
- Add toggle logic to tasks checkbox  
  → e.g., `/tasks/toggle/<id>`
- Design anchor habit model (`is_anchor: bool`)  
  → Add repo, route, test flow
- Maintain 100% test coverage  
  → Track deltas post-commit


## [Tue 15.04.25]

**Log:**
- Created `Backups/Vesper` directory for PostgreSQL container DB backups
- Centralized scripts under `User/Scripts` and added to `PATH`
  - Now `vesper-db-backup` command works from anywhere in PowerShell
- Implemented full CRUD for `tasks` (except DELETE)
  - Merged `complete_task` logic into PATCH section of new `update_task` route
- Created `tasks/dashboard.js`:
  - Enables direct cell editing via JS + `fetch()` PATCH requests
- Began generalizing `editTableField()` JS function to support editing across any Vesper table
- Initialized `npm`, set up Jest for JS unit testing:
  - Chose `node` env, used `v8` for coverage
  - Disabled coverage reports for now
  - Enabled auto-clear of mocks before each test
- Installed `jest-environment-jsdom` to mimic DOM & confirmed test runs
**NOTE:**

- Implemented delete-on-hover functionality for `Tasks` table rows
**Remaining Before Hosting:**
- Finalize and stylize delete-on-hover in `Tasks` dashboard
- Ensure checking off anchor habits works as intended
- Add input validation + warning messages for `add_task`, `add_product`, `add_transaction` templates
- Add placeholders to forms (both English & German — for lang toggle)
- Copy language toggle from Resume Site into Vesper
- Extend `editTableField()` to work across all `Tasks` fields (except ID)
**Next Time:**
1. Tweak `Groceries` dashboard to support delete-on-hover behavior

## [Sat 03.05.25]

**Log:**
- Added conditional product creation flow to `add_transaction` route
- Normalized/parsed form data, enabled re-submission with `net_weight` if product not found
- Cleanly separated `product` and `transaction` data

## [Tue 06.05.25]
**Git Goal:** Practice branching & merging

**Log:**
- Removed price tag from `Add Product` template

## [Sun 11.05.25]
**Goal:**
1. Auto-seed dummy data in dev mode after app startup
**Log:**
- Cleaned up `config.py` to use proper ENV flags (Flask built-in environment detection)
- Created `seed_db.py`, invoked during app creation to seed DB with dummy data
- Added `reset_db` route/function to:
  - Clear DB
  - Run `seed_db.py` again  
  - Return to previous page after reset (demo/dev quality-of-life)
  - Flow: Button → `/reset_db` → clears/seeds → redirect

## [Tue 13.05.25]

**Goal:**
1. Add "Reset" button for dummy DB data (drop tables → run `seed_data.py` again)
**Log:**

  - Cause: lingering "idle in transaction" connections  
  - Solution: clean session handling / teardown
**Next Up:**
1. Add logic to redirect `reset_db` route back to referrer page (referrer check)


## [Sun 18.05.25]

**Log:**
- Installed `python-dotenv`, created `.env` file  
  → Obfuscates sensitive config (e.g., DB URI) from repo

**To implement env-based config:**
- Added Flask container config to `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- Updated `config.py` to pull values from environment variables instead of hardcoding
- Flow:
  1. `.env` → contains secrets  
  2. `Config.py` reads from `.env`  
  3. Flask app gets configured  
  4. DB connects using proper URI

- Installed `gunicorn` locally to test `docker-compose.prod.yml`
  - Replaced `flask run` with gunicorn command
    - First `app`: the module (`app.py`)  
    - Second `app`: the Flask app instance inside

## [Tue 20.05.25]

**Before:**
- Configured `docker-compose.prod.yml` with proper services:
  - `db` for PostgreSQL  
  - `web` for Flask app
- Switched from `pycopg2` to `psycopg2-binary` for Docker compatibility

**Log:**
- Removed unused `pytest-postgresql`
- Cleaned up `requirements.txt` (removed unused deps)
- Added `ProdConfig` to `config.py` for production settings
- Made `create_app()` automatically use config based on `FLASK_ENV`
- Set up distinct DB URIs for different environments
- Created `wsgi.py` as prod entry point
- Set up `gunicorn` with `wsgi:app` in `Dockerfile`
- Finalized environment-aware config across codebase

---

**Project Cleanup To-Do (Post-Hosting):**
1. Write `README.md` (features, setup)
2. Refactor code structure / architecture
3. Add comments to complex logic
4. Prune comments in main + merged branches

---

**Linode Hosting Prep:**
- Installed Docker and Node.js, set up Nginx (set up Nginx to serve static directly), got a proper domain name & SSL certs

## [Wed 21.05.25]
**Goal(s):**
- Configure HTTPS access on Linode server, sort out timeout issue
- Standardize project logging format, tidy PROJECT_LOG.md
- Set up CI, establish git branch workflow
**Log:**
- Configure HTTPS - done.
- Implemented refined log format across all existing project logs
- Setting up CI/CD (continuous deployment) w/Github Actions:
	- To project root, add: .github/workflows/docker-ci.yml
	- Add SSH on server & secrets needed for CI
	- Now CI runs via Actions when we push main!
*Note: PuTTY for ssh
**Next Up:**
- Ensure local dev stuff is solid again
- Begin tackling post-hosting checklist

## [Fri 23.05.25]

- Clean up obvious issues on live site first ("£None" and "Today's Intention:[text]")
**Log:**
- Fixed above issues
- Fixed CI pipeline issue (added --build to ensure containers rebuild)
- Removed Tailwind styles output from gitignore (silly me)
**Next Up:**
1. Clean up readme/tech stack info, w/ decisions for choices
2. 2. Clean up readme/tech stack info (with decisions for choices)
3. Sort out dev/prod database separation (dev-> personal use, prod-> demo info only)
	Options:
		- Different database URIs in .env vs production environment variables
		- Maybe different database names entirely (vesper_dev vs vesper_prod) SMART, do this!
4. Add "This Week's Improvements" feature

## [Sat 24.05.25]
**Log:**
- While syncing what I did in my resume site, I made some adjustments in Vesper to match:
	- Use more semantic HTML (header, main) in base.html
		- Wrap navbar include in <header>, change block content from being in a div to in <main>
	- Condense outside 2 wrapper divs into one in navbar.html
		- Inside that, we have LEFT div (Branding & Links) then RIGHT div (Reset DB button) -> 2 birds, 1 stone :P
	- Add cursor pointer styling for btn_classes() macro

## [Sun 25.05.25]

	- Simplified create_app() with pre-configured Config class
	- Maintained flexibility for testing/overrides (can pass in configs to create_app() if desired)
	- Eliminated duplicate load_dotenv() calls
- Install Alembic and basic setup
- Create new Habit model, prune type and is_anchor fields from Task model accordingly
	- Cleanup/Refactor todos:
		- Add dashboard & CRUD routes
		- DONE?: Add dashboard.html and add_habit.html     
		- DONE?:  Remove anything for type="habit" and is_anchor from Add Task form/page
		- Refactor JS for index.html checkbox stuff to change API endpoints

## [Fri 06.06.25]
**Goals:**
1. Add 2 models:
	1. DailyIntention model -> DONE
	2. DailyMetric model -> DONE
	3. Alembic revision!
2. Make Daily Intention on homepage now use/update our new model instead of just the element's text!

**Log:**
1. Made DailyIntention & DailyMetric models
	- Alembic revision
		- Ran into issue: Since we switched from vesper to vesper_dev for our dev DB, vesper_dev didn't have an 'alembic_version' table (which is why alembic current showed nothing), but it DID have actual tables from previous migrations.
			- Fix: Just needed to run 'alembic stamp head', which basically tells Alembic: "Hey Alembic, we're actually at the latest migration"
				- It creates the alembic_version table in vesper_dev, marks it as being our latest migration, & gets everything in sync!
				- Then, we could run our revision and run alembic upgrade head
				
2. Updated Daily Intention on homepage to use DB for persistence
	- Added created_at field to DailyIntention model
	- Created get_today_intention() function in habits_repository.py
	- Updated homepage route to fetch & pass today's intention to template
	- Modified index.html: added Jinja conditional to use intention OR default text, refactor critical-task to daily-intention
Key Changes: DB schema, repository layer, route logic, template rendering

3. Other changes:
	- Fixed lazy loading errors (sneaky!) by moving habit completion logic from templates to backend
	- Refactored index.html dashboard route to pre-calculate completion status and streaks as dictionaries

**Where I Left Off:**
- Started test_habits_habit_logic.py unit test file to suss out possible race condition with our AJAX

## [Sun 08.06.25]
**Log:**
- Refactored DB management from create_all() to Alembic migrations

## [Mon 09.06.25]
**Log:**
- Added a custom base class for basics like id & timestamp information
	- Ran Alembic revision & refactored accordingly to use updated references
- Clean up environment variable handling a bit, wrap seed_dev_db route in env var conditional check

## [Tues 10.06.25]
**Goals:**
1. Get started with weather API calls
**Log:**
1. Weather API calls
	- Sign up for OpenWeatherMap (personal em, made filter for it)
	- Add API key to .env (local & server)
	- Make new api.py to use it via Flask
**Learned:**
- Async/await, basic JSON handling

## [Wed 11.06.25]
**Goals:**
1. Expand weather API widget functionality a bit
2. Start implementing an animated sun arc
	- Begin with Jest for testing pieces of this
	- Added "testEnvironment: 'jsdom'" to jest.config.js (fake browser environment)
	- Wrapped DOM code in safety checks: if (element) { element.onclick = ... }
**Log:**
1. Expanded weather API widget functionality
	- Grab sunset time
	- Make emojis display conditionally depending on weather description
2. Animated Sun arc
	- Figured out the math for a moving sun that follows actual sunrise/sunset times
	- Learned Canvas basics for this: Set up first Canvas element & drawing functions
	- Refactored these functions to separate pure match function to prep for testing
3. Diving back into Jest testing
	- Made a basic 2 + 2 = 4 Jest test
	- then a test to calc sun position at midday (should be 1)
4. Using setInterval for both getWeatherInfo & sun drawing functionalities
	- Weather info updates every hour, sun position updates every 10mins
**Learned:**
- JS modules are a mess
- Canvas coordinate system & basic transform
- Async/await flow with setInterval timing
- Separating data fetching from data usage (global caching)

**Up Next:**
1. Stylize sun so it's clearer what it is (add horizon, sun rays, etc?)
2. Add tooltip for onhover of canvas to further clarify that it moves in realtime/follows the real sun position based on sunrise and sunset of the city
3. Make it read user's timezone/city so it's not hardcoded to London
