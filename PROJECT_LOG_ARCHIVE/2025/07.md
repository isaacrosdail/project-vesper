## JULY, 2025 - Month 5


## [Wed 09.07.25]
* Working in mini_sprint branch *
**Log:**
1. Made "METRICS WE'RE TRACKING" note in Obsidian to keep the following straight
	- Put all metrics I'm thinking of tracking into a card on main page, seeing where the dust settles just to get things moving
# TODOS:
1. Add Docker checkhealth
2. Add health/status API endpoints (have Docker checkhealth ping these too)
3. Add external monitoring (also ping our health/status endpoint(s))

## [Tues 29.07.25] - CSS/UI Tweaks
**Log:**
1. Style & Theme Adjustments
  - Changed placeholder text color from blue â†’ red (blue looked too link-like)
  - Will revisit color once card background is finalized
  - Moved all theming rules into themes.css, imported via style.css
2. Misc:
  - UX Improvement: On double-click edit, auto-highlight text to make field editable state obvious
  - Found bug: update_daily_intention returning 500, unresolved at this point

## [Wed 30.07.25] - Auth Work, Flask-Login Start
**Log:**
1. Flask-Login Setup & User model enhancements

  - Centralized error messages in app/core/messages.py (currently only login-related msgs)
  - Added name and role fields to User model
  - Moved model to app/core/auth/models.py
2. Misc:
  - Bug fix: Fixed update_daily_intention 500 error
