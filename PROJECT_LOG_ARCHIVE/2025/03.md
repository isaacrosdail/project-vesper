## MARCH, 2025 - Month 1 (technically month 2 but Feb has only one entry, so we'll officially start here)

## [Sun 02.03.25] Pomodoro Timer Prototype
**Goal(s):**
- Build a Pomodoro timer that:
  - Runs locally on desktop
  - Has start, stop, reset functions
  - Tracks work vs break sessions
  - Can later be ported to MagicMirror
**Log:**
- Added SSH key to new PC
- Cloned Vesper repo to `Desktop/Projects`
- Installed Python 3.13 to `C:\Program Files\Python313`
- Set up basic file structure:
  - `pomodoro.py` – timer logic
  - `cli.py` – handles input/output
- Added multithreading for timer logic

**Next Up:**
1. Fix input handling so user can type `stop` during countdown


## [Fri 07.03.25] *(Deprecated – replaced by Flask app)*
**Log:**
- Made desktop shortcut on Pi to initiate MagicMirror
- Added hotkey (CTRL+Q) using xbindkeys to killall node
  - Appended line to `~/.xbindkeysrc`
- Created `scripts` folder on Pi 4B
  - Used `crontab -e` to add:  
    `@reboot /home/pi/scripts/start_xbindkeys.sh`

## [Sat 08.03.25]

**Log:**
- Installed OpenVoice to `user/tools` directory
  - Created venv `myvenv` and installed `requirements.txt`
  - Uses Python 3.10 (`Users/Name/Python310`)
- Installed MeloTTS (multi-lang lib?) and `unidic`

## [Tue 18.03.25]

**Goal:**
- Get barcode scanner functionality running in CLI to scan groceries and add/update DB

**Log:**
- Installed Flask, `requests`, and SQLAlchemy in venv
  - `requests` for API calls
  - SQLAlchemy to ease future PostgreSQL migration

## [Thu 20.03.25]

**Goal:**
- Basic Flask web app UI to function as "homepage" (equivalent to MagicMirror) and display current time

**Log:**
- Created basic Flask app in `app.py`
- Made `index.html` template
- Successfully displayed static date & time


## [Sat 22.03.25] 

**Goal:**
- Add `grocery.html` template to add new product to database
**Log:**
- Added templates:
  - `grocery.html` (to list grocery DB?)  
  - `add_product.html` (form to add product) ← UNFINISHED
- Quick side quest:
  - Need to merge into one unified DB under `core/database.py`
- Implemented basic barcode input: prints to terminal to confirm
  - Windows can't run scanner listener as daemon; will use `evdev` on Linux to read input from barcode scanner specifically
**Next Up:**
- Write function to add product from barcode
**Stretch Goal:**
- Make Vesper detect repeat scans and increment quantity instead of duplicating


## [Mon 24.03.25]

**Goal:**
- Add product to grocery DB from barcode  
- (Stretch) Detect repeat scans & increase quantity
**Log:**
- Switched to ORM style for DB + queries
- Created `Product` model using ORM `Base` class (will expand later)
- Stretch goal not reached (big sad)
**Next time:**
1. Tweak `add_product` to detect repeats and increment quantity  
2. Fix `grocery.html` to generate table headers dynamically


## [Tue 25.03.25]

**Goals:**
1. Tweak `add_product` logic to detect repeat scans and increase quantity
2. Make `grocery.html` table headers generate dynamically
**Log:**
- Forgot to log steps, but both goals were completed


## [Wed 26.03.25]
**Log:**
- Installed Remote Development extension in VSCode
- Successfully connected to Raspberry Pi via SSH
**Next Time:**
1. Implement `add_product` route: accept scanned barcode, enter rest of product info, add to DB, show in UI  
2. Set up Flask-Migrate: init, create/apply schema version, test with `Product` model


## [Fri 28.03.25]
**Log:**
- Finalized `Product` model as permanent barcode-to-product record
- Introduced `Transaction` model for individual scans
- Fixed barcode being incorrectly used as primary key
**Next Time:**
1. On barcode scan:
   - If **not** in `Product`, prompt for name/price → add to `Product` and create `Transaction`
   - If **exists**, just create new `Transaction`
   - Need to finalize `add_product` and `add_transaction` functions


## [Sat 29.03.25]
**Goal:**
- Sort out logic for `add_product` and `add_transaction`
**Log:**
- Updated logic for both functions (still messy, need tests)
- Installed `pytest` and `pytest-mock`
**Tests to add:**
- Validation for DB entries (e.g., price formatting)
- Make `add_product` and `add_transaction` form fields mandatory


## [Sun 30.03.25]

**Goal:**
- Begin implementing tests using `pytest` / `pytest-mock`
**Log:**
- Cleaned up DB functions in `models.py` for better modularity
- Renamed `handle_barcode` → `process_scanned_barcode`
  - Retooled to auto-add transaction upon scan
  - Still need logic to trigger `add_product` UI if product not found
- Started unit tests:
  - `conftest.py`: In-memory DB fixture
  - `test_models.py`: Initial test for `add_product`
**Next Time:**
- Add WebSocket support to redirect to `/add_product` in real-time when scanned barcode doesn't exist
