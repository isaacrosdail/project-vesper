# Project Vesper
Vesper is a personal dashboard + home assistant hybrid focused on intelligent habit tracking, system automation, and self-accountability.

## Core Features
- Daily habit prompts (anchor routines, reflections)
- Major goal logging and intention tracking
- Future: Voice, barcode, and gesture control
- Modular, expandable system

## Modules
- Pomodoro Timer
- Grocery scanning with database to enable shopping tracking, etc (eventually budgeting & calories, TBD)
- Scanning module (centralized functions for other modules in future)
  
## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (Bootstrap for styling)
- Backend: Flask/Python
- Database: PostgreSQL (May use Redis in tandem in future for performance-heavy features;; originally SQLite)
